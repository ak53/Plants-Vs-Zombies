The game is set in a post-Zombie apocalypse time. The player has to defend their house by teaming up with an army of aggresive plants who destroy every zombie that comes their way. 
Our implementation uses Java for the programming aspect and JavaFX for the visuals. Here are the features from the game that we implemented.
1) The game starts with displaying a main menu with options to start a new game, load a saved game, or start an unlocked level.
